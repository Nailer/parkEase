# ParkEase

ParkEase is a smart parking coordination platform designed for crowded environments such as stadiums, airports, hotels, large religious centers, and event venues. It enables real-time communication between vehicle owners when parking congestion causes vehicles to block one another, eliminating delays, confusion, and unnecessary traffic buildup.

The platform integrates mobile notifications with blockchain-backed parking event verification using the **Lisk ecosystem**, ensuring transparency, accountability, and scalable parking management.

## 🚗 The Problem

In high-traffic locations, parking lots are often overcrowded and loosely organized. Vehicles are frequently parked in front of or behind one another, making it difficult for drivers to exit when needed. This results in:

- Time wasted searching for the blocking vehicle’s owner  
- Traffic congestion and frustration  
- Security and safety concerns  
- Inefficient parking management for organizations  

There is currently no simple, reliable system to identify and notify the owner of a blocking vehicle in real time.

## 💡 The Solution

ParkEase provides a coordinated, technology-driven solution:

1. **Vehicle Registration at Entry**
   - Vehicles are registered using license plates or unique identifiers
   - Registration can be done manually or via QR/code-based systems

2. **Real-Time Notifications**
   - When a vehicle is blocked, a notification is sent directly to the blocking driver’s mobile device
   - Notifications are fast, private, and location-specific

3. **Organization-Level Management**
   - Parking facilities manage entries, exits, and incidents from a dashboard
   - Enables better flow control and incident tracking

4. **Blockchain-Based Verification (Lisk)**
   - Parking events and incident records are hashed and stored on-chain
   - Ensures transparency, tamper-proof logs, and institutional accountability
